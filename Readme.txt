#### Supplementary analyses  #############################################

div_sta_area_neon/fish_5year: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_neon/fish.csv, based on a standardized dataset with 14 plots continuously observed for >= 5 years

div_sta_area_neon_herb: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_neon.csv, based on a dataset including only herbaceous species

div_sta_area_neon_sst: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_neon.csv, with an additional column "sstar_ave_slope" denoting the  log-log slope of the average species stability-area relationship where the average species stability was measured by  simple weighted mean of stability across species

div_sta_area_neon_tmp/pre: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_neon.csv, based on average species stability and ecosystem stability defined as relative invariability, i.e. the ratio of species/ecosystem invariability to the temperature(tmp)/precipitation(pre) invariability within the local site.

div_sta_area_fish_EU: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_fish.csv, except that the construction of divesity&stability-area relationships were based on Euclidean distance

div_sta_area_fish_bio_full: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_fish.csv, except that the divesity&stability metrics were based on biomass data

div_sta_area_fish_bio: contaning the same variables as in  div_sta_area_fish_bio_full.csv, based on a dataset where rare species were removd

div_sta_area_full_log2_neon_tmp/pre.csv: contaning the same variables as in div_sta_area_full_log2_neon.csv, with average species stability and ecosystem stability defined as relative invariability, i.e. the ratio of species/ecosystem invariability to the temperature(tmp)/precipitation(pre) invariability within the local site.
